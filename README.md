## About Me :smile:
Hi, I’m I’m Ziwei @wylhtydtm! I’m a developmental biologist with strong interests in genomic sequencing and data analysis. My PhD project is focused on understanding the developmental/regenerative mechanisms of enteric nervous system using single-cell sequencing technology (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and nano-CUT&Tag). I’m always excited to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects.

- :seedling: I’m currently exploring **Epigenomics** and **single cell Biology**.
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on **genomic sequencing projects** and **deep-learning tools to facilitate data analysis**.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about **Enteric nervous system**, **single cell sequencing**, and **data analysis**.
