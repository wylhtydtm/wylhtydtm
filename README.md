## About Me :smile:
Hi, I’m I’m Ziwei @wylhtydtm! I’m a developmental biologiest with strong interests in genomic sequencing and data analysis. My PhD project is focused on understanding the developmental/regenerative mechanisms of enteric nervous system using single-cell sequencing technology (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and nano-CUT&Tag). I’m always excited to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects.

- :seedling: I’m currently exploring **Epigenomics** and **Bioinformatics**.
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on **genomic sequencing projects** and **deep-learning tools to facilitate data analysis**.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about **Enteric nervous system**, **single cell sequencing sample prepration**, and **data analysis**.

- :zap: Fun fact: I was pursuing pianoforte for profession before 18 but my interest was switched to science in high school and went on to do a Bsc Biochemistry in London.

## :books: My Research and Papers
I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through writing and blogging. Here are some of my latest posts:
- :memo: 
- :Paper: [DOI:(10.1038/s42003-022-03206-1 ) - Megapixel camera arrays enable high-resolution animal tracking in multiwell plates
